## 1. NATURAL DISASTER SURVIVAL

Natural Disaster Survival gets a glimpse into the battlefields of PlayerUnknown. Prepare to desperately curl up for a loving life against the elements in any shelter you can find. That's how we play PUBG anyway.

You may not fight in this Roblox game, but you will try to protect yourself from various natural disasters that are specifically designed to kill you.

On our first lap, we had to rush to the top of a glass tower to escape a flash flood. At another bend on the same map, we went back up and found that an earthquake was forcing us to move away from all tall buildings. Show the resolution of our avatar in very many parts.



## **2. SCUBA DIVING AT QUILL LAKE**

If our mothers saw us playing this little gem when we were young, they might be a little less begging for us to find real jobs. Diving at Quill Lake is everything that Doom 2016 wasn't: relaxing, healthy and relaxing.

Transportation to this scenic lake feels like a halfway decent vacation when you're quickly roaming the area in search of treasure. You can't access everything right away, however: dark caves need a flashlight, and deeper, clearer waters require additional training and better equipment.



## **3. THEME PARK TYCOON 2**

Many Roblox games are "tycoon" simulations or management games, but the Tycoon 2 theme park is one of the best. After a short and simple tutorial, you will have your large expanse of land that you can use to create your own Disneyland experiment.

The user interface is streamlined with a good range of options, but not too much to be overwhelming. As you'd expect, the goal is to create a theme park that will appeal to your attendees as the number increases, and therefore your budget as well.

Attention is paid to details here - you need to make sure you have enough trash cans and other gear to keep your guests happy and keep your park pristine. If you fail to meet your health obligations, you need to be prepared for a lot of trash covering the floor. It's not that much fun and it's a roller coaster ride to be a theme park designer.

Leaderboards, common to all Roblox games, encourage light competition to keep you going. With your online competitors' money and the number of diners constantly chasing the corner of your screen, you will be asked to keep chasing the theme park of your dreams. You may not be able to create the crazy parks you find in games like Planet Coaster, but Theme Park Tycoon is a Roblox game well worth your time.

## **4. JAILBREAK**

Jailbreak is as close as Roblox games in the world of GTA 5 RP. You first choose one of two roles: police officer or criminal. If you choose the latter, your Michael Schofield dream will come true by escaping Her Majesty's pleasure. Or you can spend the rest of your days in the cafeteria and jump on the trampolines in the back yard, which is fun too.

In order to escape, you'll need a key card that your kidnappers would prefer not to have. Anyone familiar with Fallout and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will know how the pickpocket mechanic works in this Roblox game.

## **5. HIDE AND SEEK EXTREME**

![HIDE AND SEEK EXTREME](/assets/hide-and-seek-extreme.jpg "HIDE AND SEEK EXTREME")

Hiding is a rite of passage for all school children. But where we once risked rain, nettles, and more than our fair share of worn knees, we can now enjoy the thrill of the best playground game ever from our desks with Hide and Seek Extreme.

If you are stuck in permanent detention and are unaware of the premise - you should think about a change first - a player will be randomly selected like "that" and will have to make friends after they have had a little time to immerse themselves in the imaginative maps of the game to hide.

What exactly is "Extreme" about the concept behind this Roblox game? Each "It" character has their own ability that adds a nuance to your standard game of hide and seek. You can laugh too when you feel safe in your carefully chosen location. Although we have often found that we are mainly laughed at and not the other way around. Children can be mean.
